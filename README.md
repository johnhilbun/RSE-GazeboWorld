# RSE-GazeboWorld
Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree - Project 1

This project uses Gazebo to create a building and a model. The intent is to get familiar with the Udacity workspace and with Gazeo.

Project Rubric:

Basic Requirements - Project contains:<br>
	- a **world** directory containing a Gazebo world file<br>
	- a **model** directory containing a structure and an object model file<br>
	- a **script** directory containing the C++ plugin code<br>
	- a **CMakeLists.txt** file<br>

	Building
		Project includes a house with walls:
		- structure is different than the one shown in the simulation world
		- single floor
		- enough space for robots to navigate
		- at least one feature
		- at least one color

	Modeling
		Project includes an object built using the Model Editor:
		- object is different than the one shown in the sample simulation world
		- object links are connected through joints

	Gazebo World
		Project contains a Gazebo world with multiple models:
		- world is different than the one shown in the sample simulation world
		- contains the structure model
		- contains two instances of the object model
		- contains one model from the Gazebo online library

	World Plugin
		Project contains a C++ plugin:
		- C++ code prints “Welcome to <your name>’s World!” message
		- Do not submit the build directory!
